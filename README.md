- 👋 Hi, I’m @moonlit89
- 👀 I’m interested in data management and data sciences. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL, R and Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data science and data management projects.

My background is in biosciences, but my laboratory career is gone due to shoulder injury. Durining undergrad (read: long time ago) I did SQL classes and played a little bit with database designing. I did few online data science courses but my knowledge is scattered. I am trying to give myself some structure to build up my knowledge. I am lacking confidance and it's holding me back with working on anything.
